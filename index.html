					<p id="currentyear-paragraph">This year, following the need for remote work and an increase in people looking to start the 
					journey towards managing their stress, UBC MIST has chosen to revisit our previous Project Beacon.</p>
					<p id="currentyear-paragraph">With a new focus on managing self-reported data, a more reliable machine learning system, 
					and an emphasis on understanding how stress is measured and reported, our team is hoping to make a targeted impact and 
					provide a tool to help users build a unique profile for when they chose to seek professional advice.</p>

							<p id="about-paragraph">Our team was fortunate to collaborate with the Praxis Spinal Cord Institute (previously 
							known as the Rick Hansen Institute), giving us insight into the importance of power assist
							devices for manual wheelchairs. Manual propelling a wheelchair for long stretches of time 
							can lead to shoulder injuries, and many areas have terrain unsuitable for wheelchairs. 
							Additionally, some patients with spinal cord injuries suffer impaired hand functions, 
							thus cannot properly propel wheelchairs forward. However, these devices can cost upwards of 
							$10,000 and can be a necessary but unreachable technology for many. As a result, our team 
							looked to create an affordable wheelchair power assist device for developing countries.</p>
							<p id="about-paragraph">Unfortunately, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our project had to be halted
							in favour of prioritizing the safety of our team. This project may be continued in the future.</p>
